# Power BI Project

This Project is based on Linkedin learning's course on Advanced Microsoft Power BI instructed by Helen Wall.

During the course of the project, many basic and advanced topics of Power BI were covered like how to work with calculations, leverage the DAX language, create advanced queries, and use the M language to improve the querying process. I also imported data from various sources, composed advanced formulas, managed the fields and columns in tables, used X-factor functions, conditional statements, filter results, design charts, and more.


A few of my Learning Outcomes were:


-Importing data from files or from online

-Using Query Editor

-Joining tables and creating tables

-Using quick measures and dynamic measures

-Using conditional statements

-Working with disconnected tables

-Designing charts and visualizations

-Formulating via DAX logic

-CALCULATE, ALL, FILTER

-POWER, DIVIDE, BLANK

-SUMX and COUNTX

-DATEDIFF, DATESBETWEEN, DATEADD

-MTD, QTD, and YTD

-Using X-factor functions
